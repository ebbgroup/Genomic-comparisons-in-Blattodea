The CAFE scripts in this directory were used to estimate lambda
values across the insect phylogeny based on different branch
combinations as determined with k-means, with k-values ranging
from 2 to 20.

Every branch combination model was run 5 times to ensure model
convergence. Both k-value used for k-means and the run number
are indicated in the script's file name, e.g. "**k10**\_**r1**\_cafe.sh"
is the first run of the CAFE model with 10 branch groups (clusters).

The scripts of runs 4-5 are not included in this repository since
the code of runs 1-5 is the same for each branch clustering.
