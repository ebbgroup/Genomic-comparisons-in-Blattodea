The CAFE scripts in this directory were used to estimate per-branch
lambda values as input for k-means clustering of all branches of the
phylogeny.

This was done for all of the 36 branches of the phylogeny. Each
script was run 5 times to ensure model convergence.

Both the focal branch and the run number are indicated in the
script's file name, e.g. "**b5**\_**r1**\_cafe.sh" is the first run
to estimate lambda of branch 5.

The scripts of runs 4-5 are not included in this repository since
the code of runs 1-5 is the same for each branch.
